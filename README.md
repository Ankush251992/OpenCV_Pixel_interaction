Interactive_Pixel_Manipulation
Interactive Pixel Manipulation is a robust image manipulation software package built with OpenCV. This software allows you to interact with the pixels of an image and customize the crop to fit your needs.

Key Features
Image Interactivity: The software comes bundled with three images ('Globe.jpg', 'Selfie.jpeg', 'batman__predator.jpg') and a Python script ('GettingSettingPixOCV.py'). The script leverages OpenCV to load the images, obtain their spatial dimensions, and display the original images.

Pixel Manipulation: It enables specific pixel access and modification. This allows you to interact with the image on a granular level, enhancing customization possibilities.

Image Cropping: The software provides the functionality to crop large parts of the image, facilitating precise image manipulation according to your needs.

Code Extensibility: Written in a clear and concise manner, the Python script is readily extensible. You can easily tailor it to address specific requirements.

Learning Opportunity: This software serves as an excellent learning tool for individuals new to OpenCV or image manipulation. It allows users to understand how image manipulation works in OpenCV.

Efficiency: The software has been optimized for efficiency to ensure quick and smooth image manipulation operations.

Support: We provide ongoing support for our software. This ensures that any issues or queries you encounter will be promptly resolved.
